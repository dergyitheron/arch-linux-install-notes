# Arch Linux install notes
This is my personal collection of notes and guidelines to install Arch Linux on my T450.

You can for sure follow this to install Arch on your own machine. Just consider following notes, those might be different for you:
* I have BIOS. Not UEFI. So the installation is different for you if you have UEFI. Do not follow my guidelines, it won't do any good.
* I am using Wifi internet connection.
* I am booting from USB
* I have root and swap partitions

Please, for any good reference see [Arch Wiki Installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide). I recommend to see the version in different languages, in my case there were some notes that helped me and I didn't find them in English version
